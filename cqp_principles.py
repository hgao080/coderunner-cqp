"""
CQP (Code Quality Principles) — Pylint, pycodestyle, and custom code mappings
for each principle.

Each principle is a dict keyed by tool code, with a tuple of:
    (symbolic_name, explanation)

The explanation is the pedagogical "why this matters" shown to students.

Tool prefixes:
    Pylint codes:      C0xxx, W0xxx, R0xxx, E0xxx  (4-digit)
    pycodestyle codes: Exxx, Wxxx                   (3-digit, run by _run_pycodestyle)
    Custom codes:      W90xx                         (run by cqp_custom_checkers)

Deduplication: where both tools detect the same violation, only the Pylint
code is kept (Pylint explanations are richer). The suppressed pycodestyle
equivalents are noted in comments.
    C0301  supersedes  E501   (line too long)
    C0321  supersedes  E701/E702  (multiple statements)
    W0301  supersedes  E703   (unnecessary semicolon)
    C0113  supersedes  E714   (not ... is → is not)
    C0121  supersedes  E711   (== None)
    C0121  supersedes  E712   (== True/False)

# 5. Simple Constructs
#    Principle: Coding constructs are selected to minimise complexity
#               for the intended reader.

#               to understand.

    'C0121': (

        "'if x == False', write 'if not x'; instead of 'if x == None', write "
        "'if x is None'. The simpler form is easier to read and is the Python "

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 6. Minimal Duplication
#    Principle: Code repetition is avoided.
#    Rationale: Repeated code can be difficult to change because changes
#               need to be made multiple times, there is a risk that not all
#               items are changed and/or difficult to understand because you
#               have to read more of it.

        "inconsistency. Consider extracting the shared logic into a function."

    # NOTE: R0801 operates across multiple files and requires a minimum block
    # size to trigger. For single-file CS1 submissions it will almost never
    # fire, producing false negatives. It is kept for multi-file submissions
    # but should not be relied on as a primary duplication check.
}

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 7. Modular Structure
#    Principle: Related code is grouped together and dependencies between
#               groups minimised.
#    Rationale: Placing related elements together makes code easier to
#               understand. Reducing inter-connectedness means that isolated
#               pieces can be more easily understood and can be modified
#               independently.

        'global-statement',
        "Using 'global' creates a hidden dependency between a function and "

        'constant-in-function-scope',
        "This name uses ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES, which signals a constant, "
        "but it is defined inside a function rather than at module level. "
        "Constants are usually defined at the top of the file so they are "
        "easy to find and can be shared across functions."
    ),

    # are intentionally omitted — both are class-specific and classes are out of
    # scope for the CS1 primer (Kirk et al., Table 2).
}

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 8. Problem Alignment
#    Principle: Implementation choices are consistent with the problem
#               to be solved.
#    Rationale: An implementation that reflects the problem is easier to
#               understand and change.

    # guidelines for this principle. The primer's Problem Alignment guidelines
    # concern choosing appropriate data types and control constructs for the
    # task — judgements that static analysis tools cannot make automatically.
    # Candidates for future custom checkers: detecting misused data structures
    # or overly indirect patterns for a given problem type.
